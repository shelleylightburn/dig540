## Unit 6 - SQL

These videos will introduce the keywords and syntax for writing SQL queries. Building on your existing schema, we'll learn quite a bit about reading data from your database and a little bit about inserting, updating, and deleting data.

**Assignment**

I want you to update your database to reflect any changes you want want to make over last week's database schema and the SQL naming conventions document linked above. Then, insert some test data into your database - at least enough to make some meaningful connections between tables.

Once your database is ready to go, I want you to start a new text file in your 005 directory. Write a series of queries:

- One simple SELECT statement
- A SELECT statement for each of the relationships between tables that demonstrates how they are linked by foreign keys
- Five SELECT statements that answer questions using the relationships between your tables.

Run those queries, and paste the results of the queries into the text file as demonstrated in the assignment video (export as CSV is your friend!). Include that file and a new .sql export of your database in the 006 folder and sync it to your Github fork.

This assignment is due on Wednesday Oct 25 at noon.
