The following schema represtents an attempt to organize at exhbition of classical CD's of a largely choral nature.  These are largely identified not only by title of the works being perform my the choral ensemble (eg. King's College, Cambridge), the composer of the work, and the musical director or conductor.  Sometimes soloists are included in large scale productions such as oratorios, etc. I have opted to collect this infomration under Artist on the disc itself, but be specific with the track ID's, where the different works and composers are key.  Within the choral repetoire there are different genres, by place of origin or era, so these are referenced on the left hand side of the schema.
